# Hi — I’m Akash  👋  
*Trainer · Security Researcher · Creator of hacking tools for learning & labs*

Welcome to my GitHub — this is where I share the hacking & security tools I create, along with scripts, labs, and research material.  
My focus is on making **cybersecurity concepts practical and beginner-friendly** through code, demos, and real-world inspired exercises. 🚀  

---

## 🔭 What I Do
- Build tools for **ethical hacking & research labs**  
- Develop **detection & defense simulations** for SOC / blue-team practice  
- Share **resources** for students starting their cybersecurity journey  
- Conduct research in **bug bounty, network security, and attack simulations**  

> ⚡ Everything I publish is for **educational, research, and authorized testing only**.  

---

## 🧠 Skills & Focus Areas
- Offensive Security → exploitation labs, brute-force simulations, attack tools  
- Defensive Security → log analysis, SIEM (Splunk), detection engineering  
- Bug Bounty Research → real-world vulnerabilities & methodologies  
- Linux & Automation → Bash, Python scripting for security workflows  
- Training & Teaching → networking basics, SOC analyst skills, ethical hacking

## 🔧 Projects You’ll Find Here
*(Sample names — will update as I upload code)*  

- **`net-analyzer`** → Simple log analysis helper for SOC practice  
- **`ssh-brute-lab`** → SSH brute-force simulator for detection labs  
- **`auth-fuzz`** → Authentication fuzzing demo tool for research environments  
- **`figget-raz`** → Fun CLI banner tool styled for my projects

## 🛡 Responsible Use
✔️ Students learning ethical hacking  
✔️ Security researchers building lab setups  
✔️ Blue-teamers testing detections  

❌ Never use against systems you don’t own or lack **explicit permission** to test.  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Publish my first batch of lab tools  
- [ ] Add **demo labs + tutorial Blog** for each project  
- [ ] Create video walkthroughs for hands-on learners  
- [ ] Build a community repo for practice labs
